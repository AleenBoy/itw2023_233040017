            <h2>Mike Mentzer Insane Training</h2>
            <p class="penulis">ditulis oleh <a href="#">Aqillah Lean</a>. Pada 20 Oktober 2023. </p>
            <p>Mike believed that less is more when it comes to training. This made him a strong advocate of a training philosophy known as High-Intensity Training, developed by Arthur Jones, which lifted heavyweights with relatively few repetitions and emphasized quality over quantity.

 

                According to Mentzer, this exercise style produced the best results because it minimizes muscle damage and allows for more effective workouts. However, his recommendations were controversial because they challenged the conventional wisdom that more is better when training.

                <h2>ABOUT MIKE MENTZER’S WORKOUT</h2>
                <br>
                
                <p>Mike Mentzer’s “Heavy Duty” workout routine was unique because it was a high-intensity training program that was only performed one day per week. It consisted of very few exercises per workout, each performed for one set only.</p>
